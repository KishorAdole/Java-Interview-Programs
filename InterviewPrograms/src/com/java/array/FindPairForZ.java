 * and Z = 10
 * Find the pairs (x,y) whose sum is 10
 * (2,8), (1,9), (3,7) are the pairs
 * 
 * Solution
 * 1. Sort the given array (ascending order)
 * 2. Declare left pointer (l) which points to
 * left most element of the array (min of array)
 * 3. Declare right pointer (r) which points to
 * right most element of the array (max of array)
